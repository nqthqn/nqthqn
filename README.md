Hi, I'm Nate — a web engineer with over 10 years' end-to-end expertise from ideation to implementation working in full-stack and distributed applications. History of my work lives in my [resume](https://nqthqn.com/notes/resume/). 

I have experience with languages like TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Elm, Go, SQL and, even a bit of Java, Scala and, Kotlin. I value co-creative development and "working with the garage door open." My knowledge of HTML and CSS stems from building accesible and responsive web applications and design systems. I've worked in numerous linraries/frameworks ranging from and not limited to Angular, React, TEA, Bulma, Bootstrap, Ant Design, Django, Flask.

I love knowledge gardens. I implement my own using Obsidian.

Some peculiariaties —

1. I've lived in/traveled through 35 different countries. I speak Spanish.
2. I used to juggle professionally — birthdays, carnivals, Bar Mitzvahs, school assemblies.
