Hi, I'm Nate. My expertise in frontend engineering has grown over the past 10 years. I am the type of learner who likes passing [notes](https://nqthqn.com/notes/) in class.

I have experience with languages like TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Elm, Go, SQL and, even a bit of Java, Scala and, Kotlin. I value co-creative development and "working with the garage door open." My knowledge of HTML and CSS stems from building accesible and responsive web applications and design systems. I've worked in numerous libraries/frameworks ranging from and not limited to Angular, React, TEA, Bulma, Bootstrap, Ant Design, Django, Flask.

Some peculiariaties —

1. I grew up nomadically and multilingually living/travelling through 35 different countries.
2. I used to juggle professionally — birthdays, carnivals, Bar Mitzvahs, school assemblies, block parties.
